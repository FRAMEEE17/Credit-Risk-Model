# Home Credit - Credit Risk Modeling
## Description
This project aims to develop and implement a credit risk model for Home Credit. The goal is to predict the probability of default for potential borrowers using various data science and machine learning techniques. The project leverages a variety of data sources and incorporates advanced modeling approaches to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

Additionally, this project utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance productivity and reduce the time required for writing code in the data science workflow. By integrating LLMs, we streamline tasks such as EDA, data preprocessing, feature selection, and data science report, allowing data scientists to focus on more complex and value-adding activities.
